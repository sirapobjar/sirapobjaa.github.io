		content in a book will describe about category of data structure and how to use many data which have efficiency and how many structure in many methods in data structure and we know a lot of algorithms
		about data structure. This book provides implementations of common and uncommon algorithms in pseudocode which is language independent and provides for easy porting to most imperative programming languages. 
		We assume that the reader is familiar with the following: (1) Big Oh notation; (2) An imperative programming language; (3) Object oriented concepts.</p>
